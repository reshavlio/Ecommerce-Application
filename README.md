#An e-commerce project developed with Spring Boot for the backend and React for the frontend delivers a robust, scalable, and user-friendly online shopping platform.

Backend (Spring Boot):
Product Management: Provides RESTful APIs to manage product data, including creation, updates, deletions, and retrieval of product details stored in a relational database.
User Authentication: Utilizes Spring Security to implement secure user authentication and authorization with JWT tokens for protecting endpoints and user sessions.
Order Processing: Handles order placement, inventory management, and payment integration, ensuring secure and efficient processing of transactions.
Admin Dashboard: Offers a comprehensive interface for administrators to oversee and manage products, users, and orders.

Frontend (React):
Product Display: Renders products dynamically with features like search, filters, and sorting, enhancing the user shopping experience.
Shopping Cart: Allows users to add, modify, and remove items from their cart, and proceed to checkout with a seamless process.
User Registration & Login: Integrates with the backend to provide user registration, login functionality, and personalized order history views.
Responsive Design: Ensures the application is accessible and visually appealing across various devices, from desktops to smartphones.
Combining Spring Boot and React enables the development of a high-performance, secure, and engaging e-commerce application tailored to modern shopping needs.
